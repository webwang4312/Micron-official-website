With its DPOW consensus algorithm, it features a low-power CPU working mode in which each node has complete functionality on the network with decreased algorithmic costs. While ensuring security, the complexity of the algorithm is reduced, and fast and highly concurrent payment transactions on the chain are realized. Right now any available computer can participate in the construction of the network infrastructure. The multi-language smart contract WASM supported by UENC allows developers to enter the development of DAPP more easily. UENC will use cross-chain technology to enable more high-energy-consuming encrypted assets to circulate quickly on the chain at a lower cost through the UENC network.
