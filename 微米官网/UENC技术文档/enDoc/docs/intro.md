# Overview
Welcome to the UENC development document library. This document aims to help every community user understand and use UENC.
# About UENC
## 1. What is UENC?
UENC is a highly efficient, energy-saving decentralized public chain system. With its DPOW consensus algorithm, it features a low-power CPU working mode in which each node has complete functionality on the network with decreased algorithmic costs. While ensuring security, the complexity of the algorithm is reduced, and fast and highly concurrent payment transactions on the chain are realized. Right now any available computer can participate in the construction of the network infrastructure. The multi-language smart contract WASM supported by UENC allows developers to enter the development of DAPP more easily. UENC will use cross-chain technology to enable more high-energy-consuming encrypted assets to circulate quickly on the chain at a lower cost through the UENC network. It will also be easier for enterprises or individuals to use encrypted tokens to complete the development of the DAO under smart contracts.

## 2. What is staking?
In the UENC mainnet, staking involves nodes joining the UENC network by locking a certain amount of UENC. UENC uses DPOW consensus algorithm to select verification nodes, and we use the number of UENC pledged by the user as the credential of the miner node.
## 3. Packing fee
Packing fee is the amount of UENC obtained by public network nodes through setting and processing transactions.
## 4. DPOW consensus algorithm
The Directional Proof Of Work (DPOW) algorithm in UENC uses the node signature mechanism. The initiating node signs the transaction body and transmits it to the next node through the network. The next node will verify the last signed node in turn, and the transaction will be done when the number of signatures reaches the set consensus number. The body is then returned to the transaction initiating node.
## 5. Public network nodes
The public network is a transit node that connects child nodes through which the public network node then realizes internal and external direct connection, external and external direct connection, and service transfers.
